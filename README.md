# React + Vite Landing Page

## Description

This project is a minimal setup template to get React working with Vite. It includes Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules to ensure code quality and consistency. The minimalist design ensures efficiency and ease of use, making it an ideal starting point for modern web development.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
- **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.
- **Babel**: A JavaScript compiler that converts ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards-compatible version.
- **SWC**: A super-fast compiler written in Rust for the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem.

## Rationale for Technology Choices

- **React**: Chosen for its component-based architecture and widespread adoption.
- **Vite**: Selected for its speed and efficiency in development, offering instant HMR without full page reloads.
- **ESLint**: Ensures code quality and consistency across the project.
- **Babel and SWC**: Provide options for Fast Refresh during development, with SWC offering potentially faster build times.

## Features

- React integration with Vite for fast and efficient development.
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for instant updates without full page reloads.
- ESLint configuration to enforce coding standards and catch potential issues.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone /d:/Tiedostot/A.Projects/Personal/landing-page
   cd landing-page
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Build for production:**

   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Preview the production build:**

   ```sh
   npm run serve
   ```

6. **Lint the code:**

   ```sh
   npm run lint
   ```

These instructions will help you get started with the project quickly and efficiently.

## Usage

This template can be used as a starting point for creating React applications with Vite. It is designed to be minimal yet functional, providing the essential tools needed for modern web development.

## Plugins

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md): Utilizes [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh, ensuring that changes in React components are reflected instantly during development.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc): Utilizes [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh, providing an alternative to Babel with potentially faster build times.

## purpose
